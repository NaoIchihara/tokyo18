# WS06: Applied Statistical Learning in Python
**Sat, 24 Feb 2018 (3.30PM - 5.30PM)**<br>
Calvin J Chiew/Naoaki Ichihara

## Description
This workshop aims to introduce clinicians to popular statistical methods used in machine learning, without delving into the underlying mathematical theory. We will focus on the random forest and support vector machine for classification, as well as general concepts of model fit and cross-validation. Other supervised and unsupervised learning techniques will be briefly mentioned. In the hands-on exercise, you will be asked to implement and evaluate these models on a clinical prediction problem.

## Requirements
- Laptop 
- Anaconda 5.0.1 (Python 3.6 version) installed 
  - Instructions in Japanese will be provided prior to the conference through mailing list
- Basic understanding of Python and Jupyter notebook
  - This will be covered during the main programme at 11:00AM, please attend the session if you are a new user

## Instructions
